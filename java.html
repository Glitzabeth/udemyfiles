My code simply runs the first condition as true and prints the solved statement. It doesn't seem to test my variables, hence whatever I change it to, it simply prints the first condition as true. Any suggestions on this? Thanks guys!

You are using assignment operator in your if statements instead of comparism
Ibo May 24th at 6:40 AM  

@Femi Reis just as @Anoma says, use the comparison operator (===) instead of (=).  for example    if ((room === "gallery")  && (suspect === "Ms. Van Cleve")) {
       weapon = "trophy";
       solved=true;
